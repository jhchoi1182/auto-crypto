2024-12-25 13:53:27,206 - INFO - Reason: Technical indicators suggest that Bitcoin is currently oversold, with the RSI and Stochastic oscillator indicating potential for a price rebound. The RSI is around 50 on the daily chart and has dropped below 40 on the hourly chart, signaling oversold conditions. The Stochastic K and D values are also low, reinforcing this view. The price is near the lower Bollinger Band, suggesting a potential upward reversal. While the Fear & Greed Index remains high at 73 (Greed), indicating strong investor optimism, the recent price dip presents an opportunity to buy at a lower price and reduce the average buy price of our holdings. Recent news is mixed, but the overall market sentiment remains positive. Considering our previous overcautious approach and aiming to capitalize on potential gains while managing risk, buying 40% of our available funds in Bitcoin aligns with a balanced strategy that incorporates both technical indicators and market sentiment.

2024-12-25 14:20:40,171 - INFO - Reason: Technical indicators suggest that Bitcoin is currently oversold, with the RSI and Stochastic oscillator indicating potential for a price rebound. The RSI is around 50 on the daily chart and has dropped below 40 on the hourly chart, signaling oversold conditions. The Stochastic K and D values are also low, reinforcing this view. The price is near the lower Bollinger Band, suggesting a potential upward reversal. While the Fear & Greed Index remains high at 73 (Greed), indicating strong investor optimism, the recent price dip presents an opportunity to buy at a lower price and reduce the average buy price of our holdings. Recent news is mixed, but the overall market sentiment remains positive. Considering our previous overcautious approach and aiming to capitalize on potential gains while managing risk, buying 40% of our available funds in Bitcoin aligns with a balanced strategy that incorporates both technical indicators and market sentiment.

The RSI is around 50 on the daily chart and has dropped below 40 on the hourly chart, signaling oversold conditions. The Stochastic K and D values are also low, reinforcing this view. The price is near the lower Bollinger Band, suggesting a potential upward reversal. While the Fear & Greed Index remains high at 73 (Greed), indicating strong investor optimism, the recent price dip presents an opportunity to buy at a lower price and reduce the average buy price of our holdings.

2024-12-25 14:51:25,009 - INFO - Reflection: **1. Brief Reflection on Recent Trading Decisions:**

Over the past seven days, our trading strategy resulted in a loss of **7.34%**. Our decisions were heavily influenced by overbought technical indicators such as high **RSI** and **MACD** values, and an elevated **Fear & Greed Index** at **73 (Greed)**. While aiming to mitigate risks of a potential market correction, we frequently opted to **sell** portions of our holdings. However, this cautious approach led to missed opportunities to capitalize on the ongoing bullish momentum driven by strong investor optimism and positive news. Reacting to short-term volatility without considering the broader market trend contributed to the losses incurred.
