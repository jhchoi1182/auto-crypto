Over the past seven days, our trading strategy achieved a gain of **3.15%**, marking an improvement from previous weeks. We continued to manage risk by selling portions of our holdings during overbought conditions, as indicated by high **RSI** and **MACD** values, and an elevated **Fear & Greed Index**.
